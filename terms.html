  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="meta">App: Stepper &nbsp;·&nbsp; Developer: Daniel Ryman &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
  <p>By downloading or using Stepper ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>Stepper is a step tracking and fitness app that integrates with Apple HealthKit. It offers free features (step tracking, streaks, challenges) and a paid subscription (Stepper Pro) that unlocks additional features.</p>

  <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>An account is optional but required to use Friends and Challenges features.</li>
    <li>You must meet the minimum age requirement for your country (13 in most regions; 16 in EU countries where GDPR sets a higher age of digital consent).</li>
    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account.</li>
    <li>You may not use another person's account or share your account credentials.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Stepper Pro Subscription</h2>

  <h3>4.1 What's Included</h3>
  <p>Stepper Pro unlocks premium features including extended analytics, year-in-review, Focus Mode advanced options, and additional achievements. The specific features included may change over time.</p>

  <h3>4.2 Pricing</h3>
  <p>Subscription prices are displayed in the app before purchase and may vary by region. Prices are inclusive of applicable taxes.</p>

  <h3>4.3 Free Trial</h3>
  <p>If a free trial is offered, it begins on the date you start the trial. At the end of the trial period, your subscription will automatically begin and payment will be charged unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the trial ends.</p>

  <h3>4.4 Billing & Auto-Renewal</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Subscriptions are billed through your Apple ID.</li>
    <li>Your subscription automatically renews at the end of each billing period unless cancelled at least 24 hours before renewal.</li>
    <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
    <li>You can manage and cancel your subscription at any time in <strong>iOS Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4.5 Cancellation</h3>
  <p>Cancelling stops future charges. You retain access to Stepper Pro features until the end of the current paid period. Cancellation does not entitle you to a refund for the current period.</p>

  <h3>4.6 Refunds</h3>
  <p>All payments are processed by Apple. Refund requests must be made directly to Apple at <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>. Daniel Ryman has no ability to issue refunds directly.</p>
  <p><strong>EU / UK consumers:</strong> Under applicable consumer protection law, you may have a right to withdraw from a digital content purchase within 14 days. However, by starting to use Stepper Pro immediately you acknowledge that the right of withdrawal is waived upon commencement of the service, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

  <h3>4.7 Price Changes</h3>
  <p>We may change subscription prices with reasonable notice. Continued subscription after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the new price.</p>

  <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose</li>
    <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, modify, or create derivative works of the App</li>
    <li>Use automated means to access or scrape data from the App</li>
    <li>Upload or share content that is offensive, harmful, or infringes third-party rights</li>
    <li>Manipulate step data or activity records to gain unfair advantage in social features</li>
    <li>Harass, threaten, or abuse other users</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We reserve the right to remove content or suspend accounts that violate these rules.</p>

  <h2>6. Health Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Stepper is a fitness and wellness app, not a medical device. The information provided:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is for general wellness purposes only</li>
    <li>Is not medical advice and should not be relied upon as such</li>
    <li>Should not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Always consult a qualified healthcare provider before starting a new exercise programme, particularly if you have a pre-existing medical condition.</p>

  <h2>7. HealthKit Data</h2>
  <p>Stepper accesses Apple HealthKit data strictly to power app features. We will not use HealthKit data for advertising, sell it to third parties, or share it with data brokers. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>

  <h2>8. Screen Time & Focus Mode</h2>
  <p>The Focus Mode feature uses Apple's Screen Time framework (FamilyControls) to block selected apps until you meet your daily step or distance goal. By enabling Focus Mode you are granting Stepper permission to apply app restrictions on your device via the iOS Screen Time system. You can revoke this permission at any time by disabling Focus Mode in Settings or by revoking Screen Time access in iOS Settings → Screen Time.</p>

  <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The App, including its design, code, graphics, and content, is owned by Daniel Ryman and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>

  <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App integrates with third-party services (Apple HealthKit, Apple Screen Time, Supabase, RevenueCat, Sentry). Your use of those services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the practices of third-party services.</p>

  <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy of data, or uninterrupted availability.</p>

  <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Daniel Ryman shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including loss of data or health-related decisions made in reliance on the App.</p>
  <p>Nothing in these Terms limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or any other liability that cannot be excluded by law. EU and UK consumers retain all statutory rights that cannot be waived by contract.</p>

  <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes via an in-app notice. Continued use of the App after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

  <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>England and Wales</strong>. Nothing in this clause affects your rights as a consumer under the mandatory laws of your country of residence. EU consumers may also rely on the laws of their member state where those laws are more favourable.</p>
